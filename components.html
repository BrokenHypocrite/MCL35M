The modern style is to mount the nose high, with the front wing slung underneath on pylons – all the better to channel air under the car.

Back in 1981, McLaren were the first team to introduce a carbon composite chassis and it’s proved quite popular ever since. Of course, the most important thing about it is how to pronounce ‘chassis’.
